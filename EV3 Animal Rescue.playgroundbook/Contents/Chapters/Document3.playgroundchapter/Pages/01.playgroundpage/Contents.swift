  Before you start developing your own solution, spend some time exploring these ideas.

  ### Explore Idea 1

  Sensing an object's position can help you design more adaptable solutions. In the next pages, you will explore different functions related to the [Ultrasonic Sensor](glossary://Ultrasonic%20Sensor), including:

  1.  Detect an object
  2.  Detect and count objects
  3.  Detect that something is moving closer or farther away

  ### Build

  If you don't already have an [Ultrasonic Sensor](glossary://Ultrasonic%20Sensor) connected to your EV3 Brick, build the Ultrasonic Sensor module shown below.
