  Before you start developing your own solution, spend some time exploring these ideas.

  ### Explore Idea 2

  There are various ways of helping an animal to move. In the next pages, you will use a robotic leg built around a [Large Motor](glossary://Motor%20(Large)) to experiment with controlling movement in the ways listed below.

  1.  Moving forward and backward at various speeds
  2.  Moving randomly
  3.  Moving repetitively
  4.  Moving based on sensor input

  ### Build

  Create the robotic leg shown below.
